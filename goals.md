# Goals

## Technical Goals

1.  Written in Python3
2.  verbose and takes arguments ( for example --stealth for a stealthy engagement)
3.  modular so it can be extended
4.  Creates a config file (--create-config ) interactively
5.  Stores config files in the users home directory

## Non-technical goals

1. Colaborate with others
2. establish value to streamline pen testing recon
3. Ease of use, has an example config file.
